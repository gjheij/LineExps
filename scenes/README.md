# Flickering scenes

![plot](https://github.com/tknapen/linescanning/blob/master/linescanning/examples/figures/exp_centersurround.png)

Similar to the `checkerboard_event`-experiment, but instead of a checkerboard, we have a grating with flickering scenes from the HCP-dataset. This should elicit more widespreak responses throughout the brain, thereby justifying a whole-brain acquisition. 

This experiment is based on exptools2.

To be run as:

```python main.py <sub ID> <condition> <run number> <ses ID>```
